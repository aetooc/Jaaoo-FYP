Action Input: "Westminster Abbey history and facts"
Observation: Westminster Abbey is a large, mainly Gothic abbey church in the City of Westminster, London, England. It is one of the United Kingdom's most notable religious buildings and the traditional place of coronation and burial site for English and, later, British monarchs. It has been the setting for every coronation since 1066 and is the burial site of seventeen monarchs. The present building dates from the 13th century and is considered one of the most important Gothic buildings in the country.

Action Input: "Windsor Castle history and facts"
Observation: Windsor Castle is a royal residence at Windsor in the English county of Berkshire. It is notable for its long association with the English and later British royal family and for its architecture. The original castle was built in the 11th century after the Norman invasion of England by William the Conqueror. Since the time of Henry I, it has been used by the reigning monarch and is the longest-occupied palace in Europe. The castle's lavish, early 19th-century State Apartments were largely created for George IV. They are furnished with some of the finest works of art from the Royal Collection, including paintings by Holbein, Rubens, and Van Dyck, and sculpture by Canova.

Based on the provided JSON data, there are no available flights for the given query. The error message states: "Google Flights hasn't returned any results for this query."

If there were flights available, you could extract the air ticket details by iterating through the 'other\_flights' list and accessing the relevant keys in each dictionary. However, since there are no results in this case, there is no need to perform any extraction.

Here's an example of how you could extract the details if there were flights available:

```python
flight_details = []

if 'error' not in data or data['error'] != "Google Flights hasn't returned any results for this query.":
    for flight in data['other_flights']:
        departure_airport = flight['departure_airport']
        arrival_airport = flight['arrival_airport']
        flight_number = flight['flight_number']
        price = flight['price']
        legs = [leg['flight_number'] for leg in flight['flights']]
        dates_and_times = [(leg['departure_date'], leg['arrival_date']) for leg in flight['flights']]
        
        flight_detail = {
            'departure_airport': departure_airport,
            'arrival_airport': arrival_airport,
            'flight_number': flight_number,
            'price': price,
            'legs': legs,
            'dates_and_times': dates_and_times
        }
        
        flight_details.append(flight_detail)

if flight_details:
    print("Flight Details:")
    for flight in flight_details:
        print(f"\nFlight Number: {flight['flight_number']}")
        print(f"Departure Airport: {flight['departure_airport']}")
        print(f"Arrival Airport: {flight['arrival_airport']}")
        print(f"Price: ${flight['price']}")
        print("Legs:")
        for leg in flight['legs']:
            print(f"- Flight {leg}")
        print("Dates and Times:")
        for date_time in flight['dates_and_times']:
            print(f"- {date_time[0]} to {date_time[1]}")
else:
    print("No Flights Are Available At The Moment")
```

In this case, since there are no available flights, the output would be:

Based on the provided JSON data, there are no available flights for the given query. The 'error' key contains the message: "Google Flights hasn't returned any results for this query."

If the JSON data contained flights in the 'other\_flights' list, you could extract the details using the following Python code:

```python
flight_details = []

if 'other_flights' in data and data['other_flights']:
    for flight in data['other_flights']:
        departure_airport = flight['departure_airport']
        arrival_airport = flight['arrival_airport']
        flight_number = flight['flight_number']
        price = flight['price']
        legs = []

        for leg in flight['flights']:
            departure_time = leg['departure_time']
            arrival_time = leg['arrival_time']
            departure_date = leg['departure_date']
            arrival_date = leg['arrival_date']

            legs.append(f"{departure_date} {departure_time} - {arrival_date} {arrival_time}")

        flight_details.append(f"{departure_airport} to {arrival_airport}\nFlight {flight_number}: ${price}\nLegs: {' '.join(legs)}\n")

if flight_details:
    print("\n".join(flight_details))
else:
    print("No flights are available at the moment.")
```

However, since the JSON data provided does not contain any flights, the output would still be: "No flights are available at the moment."
